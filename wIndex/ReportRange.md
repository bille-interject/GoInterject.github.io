##  Function Summary 

ReportRange() directs data into a single range of a spreadsheet with options for formatting, formulas, and columns. It is designed to populate a specific area in a spreadsheet with a list of data returned from the DataPortal. 

###  Function Arguments   

| Parameter Name      | Description  | Default | Optional |
|------|-------|---------|----------|
| DataPortal          | This is the name of the Interject DataPortal set up to connect to data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |         | NO       |
| TargetDataRange     | Designate the range in which to place the data on the worksheet. It must include at least two rows. Fetched rows are inserted in between.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         | NO       |
| ColDefRange         | Column Definition Range defines which columns from the database will be used. It can span multiple rows. It is best practice to avoid selecting entire rows because doing so it increases column quantity and memory usage. The maximum number of columns is three hundred.<!---I think it's more clear to say what selecting entire rows would do, rather than not--->                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |         | YES      |
| FormatRange         | This Range defines the format (eg. font/color) or formula to be copied down to the TargetDataRange. If left blank, the first row of the TargetDataRange format is applied. When a ColDefRange spans multiple rows, a FormatRange must be used and must match the number of rows selected in the ColDefRange.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |         | YES      |
| Parameters          | Select cells which will be used as parameters for the Data Portal. The parameters must be selected in the same order that they are specified in the Data Portal setup. The order can be checked by using the validation report. A report builder will also list the parameters correctly to help jump start building a new report. The cells must use Interjectâ€™s Param() function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |         | YES      |
| UseEntireRow        | If True, Interject will insert a row instead of a range in order to control displacement of cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | FALSE   | YES      |
| PutFieldNamesAtTop  | If the column headers are unknown, this can be used to insert names as the first row. This will only function if ColDefRange is not defined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         | YES      |
| RetainRowColumns    | This can either be a string noting the names of the columns in the ColDefRange, or a range that points to the ColDefRange items. The noted columns will be considered keys for the inserted row. When using this feature, rows are no longer cleared from the target range, but data is still cleared without deleting the rows. The columns noted as retained are not cleared, but all other ColDefItems columns are cleared. The purpose of this feature is to allow a trend of numbers to lead into calculations for forecasting. On a repull of data, it is critical that calculation formulas are not removed, but only data that is shown in the trend columns are updated. |         | Yes      |
| InsertNewRowsWithin | Defaulted to false. If RetainRowColumns are specified, the system will automatically add new rows when the key (represented by the noted columns in RetainRowColumns) is not present in the target data range. These new rows will be added to the bottom of the data range to ensure the user's calculated formulas are minimally affected. If InsertNewRowsWithin is true, the new rows will be inserted within the target range based on the alphabetical order of the key. At this time, the ability to further refine the order is not allowed.                                                                                                                              | FALSE   | YES      |
| UseTopSpacerRow     | For the TargetDataRange, adding a top spacer row inserts the data on the second row of the range and allows the first row to retain its formatting. This is used in cases where rows are inserted into the range and the user needs the ability to place the row at the top of the target range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         | YES      |

| TargetDataRange     | B14:H15              | Data will be inserted between rows 14 and 15 and will only extend from column B to column H                                    |
| ColDefRange         | B2:H2                | The column names specified in this range will determine which data fields are returned from the data source                    |
| FormatRange         | B4:H4                | The formatting specified in this range is copied down to the inserted rows in the target data range                            |
| Parameters          | Param(C7,C8,C9)      | Cells C7, C8, C9 are specified to pass information to or from the DataPortal.                                                  |

| RetainRowColumns    | ""                   | Optional Function argument left blank meaning no rows are retained upon a report clear                                         |
| InsertNewRowsWithin | FALSE                | Since there are no retained columns, this is set to FALSE                                                                       |
| UseTopSpacerRow     | FALSE                | Data is not inserted on the second row of the range; formatting is no longer defined by the first row of the target data range |
